# CFIMining
This is an implementation of several recent algorithms for closed frequent itemset mining in data streams. 

# Dependencies
* Java 8
* JUnit 4

# Datasets 
Note that the unit tests as well as the measurements for comparision rely on several datasets present in 
a `resource` directory. These datasets are not included in this repository. The IBM Dataset Generator can 
be used to generate the datasets T10I4D100K and T40I10D10K. The other datasets can be downloaded, e.g. 
the poker hand dataset can be found at <https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Poker+Hand>.
